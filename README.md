# Tech-Blog

## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- What was your motivation?

    My motivation was to build a website where a user could sign up and/or login to create posts on a blog like website. I'd like to be able to show people I am capable of building something like this and with some more time I believe I will be able to do this.

- Why did you build this project? (Note: the answer is not "Because it was a homework assignment.")

    I built this project to test my skills like many other assignments to see if I could get this website up and working, but unfortunately this time I was unable to get it working but i have filled out most files with the information to get the website working. Although it isn't working I doubt its too far from it.

- What problem does it solve?

    This would solve the issue of authentification on websites such as blogs like this one. This allows you to create an account and save your information, this can be used in a multitude of ways in the work environment.

- What did you learn?

    I learned more about routes.js and handlebars in this assignment however I was never able to get it fully working but I did learn several things and with more time I could probably get it working.

## Table of Contents (Optional)

If your README is long, add a table of contents to make it easy for users to find what they need.

    ```md
    ![alt text](assets/images/screenshot.png)
    ```

## Credits

List your collaborators, if any, with links to their GitHub profiles.

Badges aren't necessary, per se, but they demonstrate street cred. Badges let other developers know that you know what you're doing. Check out the badges hosted by [shields.io](https://shields.io/). You may not understand what they all represent now, but you will in time.
